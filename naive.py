    The Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic classification algorithm
    that is based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence between 
    features (as this we call the term "naive"). It is often used for classification tasks
    when the features are continuous and assumed to have a Gaussian (normal) distribution.

     Cross Validation to evaluate the performance
    Step-by-step explanation of how the data is split into 5 folds:
        a)The entire dataset is divided into 5 equal-sized subsets.
        b)In the first iteration, the first fold is used as the validation set, and the remaining 4 folds are used for training.
        c)In the second iteration, the second fold is used as the validation set, and the other 4 folds are used for training.
        d)This process continues for the remaining folds until all 5 folds have been used as the validation set once.
        e)The performance of the model is evaluated on each fold, and the results are typically averaged to obtain an overall performance measure.
