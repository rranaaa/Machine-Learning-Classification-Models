    param_grid: This variable likely holds a dictionary specifying the grid of 
                parameters to search during the hyperparameter tuning process.
    'n_estimators': This parameter represents the number of trees in the forest.
                    In this case, the model is being tuned over three values:
                                      50, 100, and 200.
    'max_depth': This parameter controls the maximum depth of each tree in the 
                 forest. It's being tuned over 
                 three values: no maximum depth (None), 10, and 20.
                 
    The process takes a long time because it involves training multiple models
    with different combinations of these parameters to determine the optimal 
    configuration.
